ðŸ›’ AutoCart â€“ Mood-Based Product Recommendation Engine

AutoCart is an AI-powered, personalized shopping assistant that recommends products based on the user's current emotional state. By analyzing natural language input, AutoCart detects the user's mood using a trained machine learning model and suggests suitable product categories through mapped business rules, retrieving real-time product listings via the Walmart API.

---

Project Objective

The main goal of AutoCart is to enhance e-commerce personalization through **emotion-aware product recommendations**. Instead of traditional filters like category or price, this system dynamically adapts suggestions based on how the user feelsâ€”bringing emotional intelligence to online shopping.

---

Use Cases

- Personalized e-commerce recommendations based on emotion
- Emotionally supportive product suggestions during stress, anxiety, or excitement
- Retail applications for targeting mood-influenced buying behavior
- Health-aware commerce platforms promoting mindful consumption

---

Key Functionalities

- âœ… NLP-based mood prediction using custom ML model
- âœ… Mapping of mood categories to relevant product types
- âœ… Real-time product fetching using the Walmart API
- âœ… Visualization of user mood trends over time
- âœ… Refill reminders based on product usage patterns
- âœ… User data logging for personalization and insights

How It Works

1. **User Input**
User types a short message like:  
`"I'm feeling really stressed and exhausted lately."`

2. **Mood Detection**
`moodcart_model.py` uses a trained NLP classifier to categorize the input as:  
**Detected Mood:** `Stressed`

3. **Category Mapping**
`autcart_rules.py` maps `Stressed` to:
**Product Category:** `Wellness & Self-care Products`

4. **Product Retrieval**
`walmart_api.py` uses the Walmart API to fetch relevant live product listings like:
- Herbal teas  
- Aromatherapy oils  
- Relaxation kits  

5. **Result Display**
- Products shown on UI via Streamlit
- Mood and results logged in `user_history.json`
- Mood history visualized using Plotly graphs

Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autocart-mood-recommender.git
cd autocart-mood-recommender
````

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

```
WALMART_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
DB_USER=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=autocart
```

4. **Run the App**

```bash
streamlit run main_app.py
```

Sample Output

```
Input Mood Text: "I feel tired, mentally and physically."
â†’ Detected Mood: Fatigued
â†’ Product Category: Health Supplements, Energy Drinks
â†’ Walmart Recommendations: [Vitamin C Tablets, Gatorade Energy Pack, ...]
```
